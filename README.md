## Important locations:

`/public` - here are document files stored

`/src` - here is the source code of the site and where pages are created

## How to make a new page:

To make a new page you can copy one of the avabile pages in `/src/pages` and rename it and put it in `/src/pages/{PATH}` where `PATH` is the location relative to the site's domain (cuza.pages.dev/{PATH}).

You will probably need to change the navbar of the page so go to `src/components/Navbar.astro`
and add at the end of the `<ul>` respecting the same format, making necessary changes for your page's PATH.

## Rules:

- Please respect the format of pages.

- Try to imagine this repo as someone else's house 🏠, try not to bring dirt 💩 in it.

- Use Romanian for content and English for documentation in GitHub.

## Extra:

- Try to be open 🤗 to changes of your code at push commits (most of the time they aren't needed if the impovements look good).

- You can specify the alias you want for contribuing (at the bottom of pages) 😊.
